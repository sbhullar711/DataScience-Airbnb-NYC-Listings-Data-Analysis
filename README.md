#Project overview
In this project I used the "Airbnb NYC Listings Data", the  project focuses on utilizing the Airbnb price data of the New York area to gain insights and draw conclusions about the listing activity and metrics in the city during the year 2019. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of various aspects, including host listing, host information, geographical location, availability throughout the year, minimum nights and key metrics required for making predictions and understanding the factors that impact listing prices.
By conducting a thorough analysis of this dataset, I uncovered patterns, trends, and relationships between different features and the prices of Airbnb listings in New York City. Through exploratory data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling techniques, I identified the significant factors that influence pricing decisions for Airbnb hosts in the area and drew charts to present the data.
In this project I showcased the application of data science methodologies, including data preprocessing and cleaning, and predictive modeling, to provide valuable insights about the data
